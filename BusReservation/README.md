# Bus Project in Java

A simple bus project implemented in Java that utilizes concepts of linked list and arraylist to manage bus information. Real-time date and time are imported for accurate timestamping of bus operations.

## Features 🚍

- Maintain a list of buses with their details such as bus number, route, and schedule.
- Add new buses to the list and display the updated list.
- Remove buses from the list and display the updated list.
- Search for buses based on bus number or route.
- Display real-time date and time for accurate timestamping of bus operations.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, a popular object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence and wide usage in various applications.
- **Linked List**: Linked list data structure is used to implement the list of buses, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- **ArrayList**: ArrayList is used to store and manage the list of buses, providing dynamic resizing and random access to elements.
- **Date**: The Date class from the java.util package is imported to get the real-time date and time for accurate timestamping of bus operations.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Used 🛠️

The project showcases the following OOP concepts:

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is used to create classes for different types of buses that inherit common properties and behaviors from a parent class.
- **Encapsulation**: Private access modifiers are used to encapsulate the data members of classes and ensure data integrity.
- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is used to handle different types of buses and perform operations on them using a common interface.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes are used to define common properties and behaviors of buses, allowing for easy extension and customization in child classes.

## Usage 📝

1. Compile and run the Java program in your favorite Java IDE or compiler.
2. Choose from the menu options to perform various bus operations, such as adding, removing, searching, or displaying buses.
3. Real-time date and time will be displayed for accurate timestamping of bus operations.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter bus information and perform desired operations.

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- Implement error handling and input validation to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.
- Add support for persisting bus data to a database for data persistence across program runs.
- Implement additional functionalities, such as updating bus details, sorting buses by different criteria, and displaying statistics.
- Improve the user interface and add interactive features to enhance user experience.

## Conclusion 🏁

This bus project in Java demonstrates the usage of linked list and arraylist data structures, as well as real-time date and time, to manage bus information. It also showcases various OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Feel free to use and modify this project as needed for your own purposes. Happy coding!
